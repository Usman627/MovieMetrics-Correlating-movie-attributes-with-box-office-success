# MovieMetrics: Correlating movie attributes with box office success

This project aims to analyze the correlation between different factors that contribute to the success of a movie, such as budget, gross, ratings, and other relevant columns. The objective function of this analysis is to determine the impact of each of these factors on the gross earnings of a movie.

To achieve this, the project takes inputs such as movie name, budget, gross, ratings, and other relevant columns. Using this data, the project calculates the correlation between the different elements, and generates heat maps to visualize these correlations. Based on the results from the correlation analysis, various relationships between the different factors are built.

Finally, the project uses the results of the correlation analysis to generate a regression model, which can be used to predict the gross earnings of a movie based on its budget, ratings, and other relevant factors. This project is useful for filmmakers, producers, and investors who want to make data-driven decisions about their movies, and maximize their profits.
